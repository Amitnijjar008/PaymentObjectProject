# PaymentObjectProject
PaymentObject class file with unit tests


This project uses Java and SQL (h2 jdbc) to complete a requested code challenge:



/*
 
Coding language:   Java 
Repo : Use github 
•   Create an object/class, call it PaymentObject, it has three fields, paymentNumber, amount and date
•   Use DB of your choice and persist list 1000 of Payment objects (you can use JUnit or any other method to populate your DB)
•   Write two methods, each using a different sorting algorithm and not using built in sorts or external libraries, to sort a List of an n-Payment objects from most recent to oldest.
•   Write at least two JUNIT tests (one per method) to generate a randomly ordered list with random payment dates  and sort them. Record the time it takes to sort and verify that the list is ordered correctly.
